## 1. Introduction

This report describes the process of developing an application for **BDOT10k geospatial data collection** in Park Jordana, Kraków, using the **QField** mobile application, a GIS tool based on **QGIS**. This tool allows for real-time geospatial data collection, editing, and analysis on mobile devices, which was crucial for efficient fieldwork.

The project was based on national regulations specifying guidelines for BDOT10k data collection—a database that includes topographical information for both rural and urban areas in Poland. Our fieldwork involved gathering data on park infrastructure, such as paths, rest areas, signage, and landmarks, ensuring the data collected aligned with national standards.

## 2. Selection of Thematic Layers

Given the extensive range of BDOT10k data, we focused on key thematic layers for our application. After a brainstorming session, we identified the essential infrastructure elements in Park Jordana. Below is an example screenshot of the selected thematic layers:

## 3. Development of Dictionaries

To streamline our workflow, we created dictionaries with standardized terms and descriptions for BDOT10k data layers. Each team member was responsible for a subset of terms, ensuring consistency and accuracy in data interpretation and attribute values. This step was essential for creating a uniform and coherent dataset.

## 4. Creating Layers for Analysis

We developed specific layers for data analysis within QField, configured according to BDOT10k standards. These layers included elements like paths, rest areas, and signage to capture relevant park infrastructure accurately.

## 5. Adding an Orthophotomap

An orthophotomap was incorporated into our QField project to provide a spatial reference and enhance data collection accuracy.

## 6. Data Import to QField

Data from our GIS project were successfully imported into QField, allowing us to work seamlessly on mobile devices in the field.

## 7. Field Data Collection

Field data collection was conducted in Park Jordana. We recorded various geospatial features of park infrastructure, adhering to the standards set out in the BDOT10k guidelines.

## 8. Data Export

Once data collection was completed, we exported the gathered data for further processing and analysis.

## 9. Processed Map

The final map created based on our collected data is displayed below:

## 10. Summary

This project provided valuable experience with **BDOT10k data** collection and processing using QField. While QField proved useful in the field, personal preferences suggested that **FieldMaps** might offer a more user-friendly experience. Nonetheless, this project enriched our knowledge of BDOT10k data standards and the practical use of mobile GIS tools in geospatial data collection.
